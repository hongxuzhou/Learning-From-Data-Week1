# Learning-From-Data-Week1
This repository contains my work for the first assignment of the Applied Machine Learning course.

## Structure
While the original assignment files are provided as Python scripts, I chose to use Jupyter Notebooks for easier organisation and debugging. Please note that some code in these notebooks may not be suitable for formal submission as part of the assignment.

## Approach
For each algorithm required in the assignment, I've created a separate notebook focusing on testing and evaluation. This simplified approach allows for an easier understanding of each method.

## Note
This repository is a work in progress and represents my learning journey. The code and structure may be subject to changes as I continue to work on the assignment.
