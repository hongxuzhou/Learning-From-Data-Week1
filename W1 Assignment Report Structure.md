# Title: Optimising Multi-class Sentiment Analysis through Text Preprocessing Techniques

## Abstract

## Introduction & Literature Review

- The problem of multi-class sentiment analysis in the context of online review
- Motivation: The importance of accurate sentiment classification for business and marketing (and maybe more fileds)
- Existing approaches (sentiment analysis, text preprocessing)
    - Classical ML vs. Deep Learning
        - Possibly something like *While DL has shown promising results on larger datasets and more nuanced sentiments detection (citation required), classical ML methods remain competitive for smaller, domain-specific tasks (citation required)*
    - Feature engineering techniques
        - Stemming and/or lemmatisation
        - N-gram
        - NER
        - POS
        - …
    - Briefly evaluate the techniques
        - e.g., stemming is good at xxx, but it may cost yyy
    - The ongoing debates and inconsistency
- Express the necessity of our study
    - maybe something like: *Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the impact of various preprocessing techniques and their combinations on different ML algorithms for multi-class sentiment analysis*
- Introduced research questions and approach
    - RQ1
    - RQ2
    - …
- Summarise the methods and findings
